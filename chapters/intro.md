## About

Hi! I am Sheng Li, a PhD student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Southeast University. My academic interests lie broadly in image processing and computer vision, in particular image authentication and image tampering detection.

Previously I studied Electrical Engineering at UNSW, where I was part of UNSW Smart Campus group, working with [Hassan Habibi Gharakheili](http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~hhabibi/) on data analytics for Internet-of-Things and its applications to smart campus.
