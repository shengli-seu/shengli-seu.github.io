# Zeiss algorithm develop

Task lists
1. Familiarity with image acquisition system [SurfMax](https://www.zeiss.com/metrology/products/systems/surface-defect-detection/surfmax-s.html) for surface defect inspection
   and its camera settings aka **fov** 
2. Optical technology: **phase shift deflectometry** (fringe pattern generating and raw images)
3. Image fusion:**compute image channels** (e.g. grayscale, modulation, phase and so on)
4. **Image registration**: camera section cropping
5. K-means based **image segmentation**: logo cropping
6. Edge detection
7. Object detection with deep learning
8. Document presentation
   - Deep learning algorithm review: document; slices after collecting at least 20 algos; ï¼ˆkey points: classification / backbone, object detection, image augmentation, model compression*)
   - Readme document and code for task 4-6
